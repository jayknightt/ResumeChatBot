The Resume Reader Bot
Yo, yo, yo, check it out
I got something to tell you about
It's a bot that's got the skill
To help recruiters fill jobs at will

It's called the Resume Reader Bot
And it's powered by the GPT-3 slot
This AI can read resumes like a pro
And give you insights that make you go whoa!

No more reading resumes by hand
That's so last year, it's not in demand
This bot can parse through a pile
And pick out the top ones with style

It can find the keywords you're looking for
Like "Java," "Python," or "C++" galore
It can tell you about their experience and skills
And even point out their education, if it's a thrill

But that's not all, there's more to explore
This bot can even suggest more
Like which candidates are a good match
And which ones you should dispatch

So, if you're tired of the resume game
And you want to take your hiring to the next level, not the same
Try the Resume Reader Bot, it's the real deal
And it will help you find the best candidates with zeal
